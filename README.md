# Venus

It's like Jupyter, but lighter, faster, and hotter. Integrates Python and LaTeX
into one markdown document.

## Installation

With [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), in your ~/.vimrc:
(then install with `:PluginInstall`)
```vimscript
Plugin 'tim-clifford/vim-venus'
```

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):
```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/tim-clifford/vim-venus
```

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), in your ~/.vimrc:
(then install with `:PlugInstall`)
```vimscript
Plug 'tim-clifford/vim-venus'
```

With Vim 8+'s default packaging system:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/bundle/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/bundle/start
git clone https://github.com/tim-clifford/vim-venus
```

# Dependencies

- [skywind3000/asyncrun.vim](https://github.com/skywind3000/asyncrun.vim)

- An installation of pandoc with xelatex (e.g. `pandoc` and `texlive-most` on
  Arch Linux

- Linux (this may work on other operating systems, and I will review PRs aimed
  at them, but I do not intend to actively maintain them)

Optional:

- [tim-clifford/jupytext.vim](https://github.com/tim-clifford/jupytext.vim)
  (forked from [goerz/jupytext.vim](https://github.com/goerz/jupytext.vim) to
  make a minor change) to automatically convert `.ipynb` notebooks to markdown

- [tim-clifford/vim-snippets](https://github.com/tim-clifford/vim-snippets)
  (forked from [honza/vim-snippets](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets)) to
  enable LaTeX snippets in markdown files

# Usage

Markdown works as it normally would with pandoc, including inline LaTeX. Venus
recognises python blocks and will put the result into another code block after
the python block. Existing blocks generated by venus will be replaced.

Here is an example:

    ```python
    print("Hello world!")
    ```

will become

    ```python
    print("Hello world!")
    ```
    ```output
    Hello world!
	```

Any errors which occur will be put into a separate code block like so:

    ```python
    print("Hi world")
    6 = 0
    ```
    ```error
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        6 = 0
        ^
    SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
    ```
    ```output
    Hi world
    ```

# Mappings

The following mappings are enabled by default (they can be disabled with
`let g:venus_mappings = 0`). Venus will start when you open a file which
containts code blocks it understands how to run (currently `python`). It will
close when vim closes (or you can use `:call venus#ExitAll()` if you like)

```vimscript
" Start venus automatically on all markdown files which have a code block
" venus understands
augroup venus
	autocmd!
	autocmd FileType markdown :call venus#StartAllInDocument()
augroup END

" Run cells
nnoremap <leader>vx :call venus#RunCellIntoMarkdown()<CR>
nnoremap <leader>va :call venus#RunAllIntoMarkdown()<CR>

" Compile PDF
nnoremap <leader>vp :call venus#PandocMake()<CR>

" Run all cells and compile PDF
nnoremap <leader>vm :call venus#Make()<CR>

" Restart all interpreters, run all cells, and compile PDF
nnoremap <leader>vr :call venus#RestartAndMake()<CR>

" Jump beween cells
nnoremap <leader>vc /\v```%(error\|output)@!.+<CR>
nnoremap <leader>vC ?\v```%(error\|output)@!.+<CR>
```

# Optional settings

See `pandoc-examples` to get you started with configuring pandoc, also have a
look at the pandoc documentation.

```vimscript
" Location of pandoc yaml configuration file
let g:pandoc_defaults_file = '~/.config/pandoc/pandoc.yaml'

" Directory of latex headers to be included
let g:pandoc_header_dir = '~/.config/pandoc/headers'

" Pandoc theme file for syntax highlighting
let g:pandoc_highlight_file = '~/.config/pandoc/dracula.theme'

" Miscellaneous command like pandoc options
let g:pandoc_options = '-V geometry:margin=1in'
```

# Known Issues

- There is currently syntax highlighting for markdown and python but not LaTeX
  (but there are LaTeX snippets!)

- Occasionally the python interpreter needs an extra like to process a block of
  code. For example:
```python
for i in range(2):
	print("foo")
print("bar")
```
results in
```error
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    print("bar")
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
because the python interpreter requires an extra line after the end of blocks.
