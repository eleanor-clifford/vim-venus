# Venus

It's like Jupyter, but lighter, faster, and hotter. Integrates languages with a
REPL and LaTeX into one markdown document. Currently python, shell, and haskell
REPLs are supported.

## Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager. For example with
[Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim):
```vimscript
Plugin 'tim-clifford/vim-venus'
```

# Dependencies

- [skywind3000/asyncrun.vim](https://github.com/skywind3000/asyncrun.vim)

- An installation of pandoc with xelatex (e.g. `pandoc` and `texlive-most` on
  Arch Linux

- Linux (this may work on other operating systems, and I will review PRs aimed
  at them, but I do not intend to actively maintain them)

Optional:

- [tim-clifford/jupytext.vim](https://github.com/tim-clifford/jupytext.vim)
  (forked from [goerz/jupytext.vim](https://github.com/goerz/jupytext.vim) to
  make a minor change) to automatically convert `.ipynb` notebooks to markdown

- [SirVer/ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) to enable snippets

- [lervag/vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) for advanced LaTeX usage

# Usage

Venus allows you to run code blocks from markdown into an output block. It is
enabled on all markdown files by default. Existing blocks generated by
Venus will be replaced.

Here is an example:

    ```haskell
    putStrLn "Hello world!"
    ```

will become

    ```haskell
    putStrLn "Hello world!"
    ```
    ```output
    Hello world!
    ```

Any errors which occur will also be put into the output block like so:

	```python
	print("Hi world")
	6 = 0
	```
	```output
	Hi world
	File "<stdin>", line 1
		6 = 0
		^
	SyntaxError: cannot assign to literal
	```

Venus also provides a simple variable explorer for python, which shows variable
names and their value in the quickfix list. This can be extended to other
languages.

By default vimtex is also started in markdown files (if it is installed). This
can be disabled, see [doc/venus.txt](./doc/venus.txt)

If Venus is misbehaving, you can see the raw REPL output in the job buffers,
named according to the name of the language. (Only in vim currently, not
neovim)

A number of mappings are enabled by default (they can be disabled). For a full
